{/**You are given two positive integers, A and B.
Calculate the sum (A + B), difference (A - B), product (A * B), and quotient (A / B).
If at least one of these four values is exactly equal to 9, return the string "Nine". Otherwise, return "Nein".

Example 1
Input: a = 5, b = 4
Output: "Nine"
Explanation: A + B = 9

Example 2
Input: a = 10, b = 1
Output: "Nine"
Explanation: A - B = 9

Constraints
A and B will be positive integers.
A and B will be between 1 and 1000. */}
